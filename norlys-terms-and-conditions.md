**1. General **


These Terms of Use (the "Terms of Use") are entered into between the entity/person using or accessing the  Services (the "User" or "you") and Norlys Energi A/S ("Norlys" or "we"), collectively referred to as the  "Parties" or each a "Party". 


These Terms of Use govern your use of the Services provided in Norlys' platform for electric car drivers and  charge points operated by Norlys under its own brand, Norlys Opladning (“Norlys Opladning”). The Services include features and functionalities, including but not limited to websites, user portals, mobile applications,  content, and user interfaces, associated with Norlys Opladning, where users can manage and find charge  points to initiate and pay for charging processes of electric vehicles (the "Services"). 


Norlys Opladning is a white label charge point operator platform supported and operated by Monta ApS  (“Monta”) on behalf of Norlys. 


**2. Acceptance **


By registering for the Services, you accept these Terms of Use, which allow you to use the Services. 


All transactions that are part of the Services including, but not limited to, initiating charging sessions as well  as using RFID cards, are governed by these Terms of use. Registration without explicit acceptance of these  Terms of Use is not possible. 


**3. Prices **


For consumers, all applicable prices are listed inclusive of VAT. For businesses, applicable prices are  exclusive of VAT or unless otherwise stated.  


Before the charging process, the price will be clearly displayed as fees per kWh of consumed energy,  parking fees for time of parking at the charging station, charging session starting fees, fees for time of  charging, and transaction fees as applicable. There may also be fees applicable if the User reserves a  charging station, which remain unused or in case of the User overstaying such reservation.  


Norlys estimates the charging price prior to the initiation of a charge and reserves the necessary amount if  relevant. You acknowledge that the final and payable price of the charging service is directly dependent on  actual use, for example on the amount of consumed electricity, and is therefore not always automatically  provided before the start of the charging process. 


Norlys will deliver a receipt of the use of the charging Service, including each charging transaction executed. **4. Billing **


Norlys may charge you via a variety of payment methods, such as your debit/credit card, or by Norlys  invoice.


Invoices may be sent by Norlys via mail, email, or OIO invoice and are also accessible in your Norlys account at www.mitnorlys.dk. Payment for invoices issued must be received by Norlys no later than two  business days after the end of the month of the issue date of the invoice, unless otherwise stated or agreed.  The due date will be stated on the invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to an interest of 1.5% per month on  any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by Danish law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of  collection. 


Norlys may suspend access to the Services, with immediate effect, if the User fails to pay any fees invoiced  by Norlys pursuant to these Terms of Use. Suspension will not relieve the User of its obligation to pay such  invoices or any other fees payable to Norlys for the relevant Services. 


**5. Obligations **


You must cooperate with Norlys by providing such information and materials as Norlys may reasonably  require in order to supply the Services and ensure that such information is complete and accurate in all  material respects. 


It is your responsibility to ensure that the registered payment method is valid, that it has a sufficient balance  and is not blocked. In the event that debiting is not possible, Norlys reserves the right to temporarily suspend  your access to the Services or part of it until the overdue balance is fully paid. Norlys has the right to seek  payment from you by other means, such as by sending a separate invoice for your use of the Services. 


You are responsible for complying with the specific parking restrictions and regulations at the charging  station (such as written instructions shown at the charging station, or the instructions given by the personnel  of the charging station operators). 


You shall use the charging station correctly and in accordance with the provided instructions and ensure that  the charging station is suitable for the vehicle to be charged. If the charging station is damaged or defective,  the User should inform Norlys. 


When you initiate a charging session of an electric vehicle through the Services using a public charging  station not operated by Norlys, Monta will act as an agent on behalf of Norlys to conclude your order. If  during this process Monta has received an amount payable by a User to Norlys, such payment shall  discharge the User of any payment obligation towards the public charge point operator. Norlys is not liable  and does not take any responsibility for the charging services provided by other public charge point  operators than Norlys. You must take due care to protect your Norlys account against misuse by others and  promptly notify Norlys about any detected misuse. You are responsible for keeping your account secure and  not granting access to your account to others.

In the event of the loss of your charging key or the mobile phone on which the application operated by Norlys has been installed, you shall immediately notify Norlys. Norlys may then block your access to the Services. If  you do not give such notification and the charging key or the mobile phone in question remains in illegitimate  use, Norlys reserves the right to claim incurred losses as a damage from you in accordance with applicable  


law. For the sake of clarity, this clause does not constitute additional claims for damages against you as a  consumer. 


You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable regulations, laws, or conventions  before using the Services.


Unless explicitly granted to You in writing by Norlys, You must not (and must not allow any third party to)  directly or indirectly: I.

**6. Liability **


The use of the Services is the sole responsibility of the User. The Services are supplied "as is" and may be  modified, updated, interrupted, suspended, or discontinued at any time without notice or liability. 


All warranties, conditions and other terms implied by statute or law are, to the fullest extent permitted by law,  excluded from these Terms of Use.

These limitations are independent from all other provisions of these Terms of Use and shall  apply notwithstanding the failure of any remedy provided herein. 


**7. Force Majeure **


Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligation under these Terms of Use (except  payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, epidemic, pandemic, failure or reduction of power or  telecommunications or data networks or services, IT manipulation, or government act. 


**8. Termination **


These Terms of Use may be terminated by either party without notice at any time for any reason. After  termination, you will no longer have access to the Services. 


All sections of these Terms of Use which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination,  including, without limitation, accrued rights to payment, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and  limitations of liability. Thus, the termination does not affect existing claims with respect to the charging  processes that have previously taken place, including the obligation to pay for all charging sessions you  initiated before the termination.

**13. Consumer cancellation and complaint rights **


Charging services: The right of cancellation ceases from the time a purchase of a service/a charging session  has been completed. If, in connection with the purchase of charging services, you have requested that the  charging supply commences before the expiry of the cancellation period, and you still wish to cancel, you  must be aware that we will charge a reasonable payment for the part of the service that was already delivered at the time of cancellation. When such service has been completed, the right of cancellation ceases. 


Dispute resolution: Any claim under Danish law may be brought before the Danish Consumer Complaints  Board or the Danish Center for Complaints Resolution, which can be accessed on the website of the Center  for Klageløsning og Forbrugerklagenævnet (naevneneshus.dk). An alternative dispute resolution procedure  is also offered by the European Commission to citizens of EU and EEA member states through their platform  for Online Dispute Resolution. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of this procedure, you can still bring  ordinary legal proceedings. 


**14. Personal Wallet and Team Wallets **


The personal wallet is a virtual payment method which can be used to pay for charging your electric vehicle by funds placed in your personal Norlys account directly by use of Norlys Opladning or by use of a charge  key connected to your account (“Personal Wallet”). The Personal Wallet can be loaded by a User by means  of credit card or other accepted payment methods. The User may deposit funds to their Personal Wallet  either manually or automatically when the balance goes below a certain amount. The User may also  withdraw their balance from their Personal Wallet. Norlys does not charge fees for the deposit or withdrawal  process. 


If the Personal Wallet is chosen as payment method for a charge and the Personal Wallet has insufficient  funds for the estimated price a charge, the User will be asked to ensure sufficient balance on the Personal  Wallet prior to authorization of the charge, or to choose an alternative payment method. Before accepting to  initiate the charge in Norlys Opladning, you will be asked to enter your personal security 4-digit code. Once a  charge is authorized by use of the Personal Wallet, the amount corresponding to the charge price is charged  from the Personal Wallet immediately after the charging session. 


You may not place funds in the Personal Wallet in excess of DKK 2,000. Each transfer to top up your  Personal Wallet is capped at DKK 1,000. A deposit request in excess of this amount will be rejected. Funds  on your Personal Wallet may be used only to pay for charging services in Norlys Opladning facilitating your  charging. In the event of a negative balance in the Personal Wallet, the User is required to immediately  deposit funds to settle the balance. A Personal Wallet may be blocked by Norlys in the event of a negative  balance which has not been re-filled after a written notice. 


The User may be added to private team wallets in Norlys Opladning (a “Team Wallet”). Access to a Team  Wallet allows the User to initiate charging sessions on the charging points available through the relevant  Team Wallet. 


If you have a charging operator subscription with Norlys, a Norlys Team Wallet will be available on your  account in Norlys Opladning. The Norlys Team Wallet allows you to pay for your charging sessions on a  monthly basis with your accumulated consumption being settled on your charging operator subscription  


invoice (or on your Norlys electricity invoice, if applicable). The Norlys Team Wallet will display your virtual  balance to be settled on the forthcoming subscription invoice (or Norlys electricity invoice, if applicable),  including any right to electricity tax refund. The Norlys Team Wallet can be used to pay for charging of your  electric vehicle on any charging point (private or public) available to you on Norlys Opladning.  

A charging key can only be connected to one wallet at a time. If the User has access to the Norlys Team  Wallet, the User’s charging key will automatically be connected to your Norlys Team Wallet. The User may  choose to connect the charging key to another wallet, e.g. the Personal Wallet. 


The User shall regularly review the transactions to make sure they correspond to their actual charging. The  User shall notify Norlys as soon as possible in the event of any incorrect registrations. If you become aware  of any misuse, or if you lose your charging key, you are required to deregister the charging key in your  account, and to contact Norlys support so we can block the account and avoid any misuse. Contact Norlys on opladning@Norlys.com or +45 8710 1540.


The User is liable for any payments made by use of a Wallet. In the event of misuse by a third party or  unauthorized use of a Wallet, Norlys shall cover the loss a User may have suffered, provided the User has  not acted fraudulently, has adhered to these terms, and as soon as possible after the incident has informed  Norlys hereof, in accordance with the Danish Payment Act. Any objections to a transaction due to an  unauthorized or incorrect transaction shall be notified to Norlys as soon as possible after the disputed  transaction. When assessing whether objections have been notified as soon as possible, the requirement to  regularly review the transactions will be considered. 


It is of great importance to Norlys that our users are comfortable using our payment options, including the  Wallets. Any personal information used for a purchase or use of a Wallet is processed responsibly and in  compliance with applicable payment and data protection laws. Please refer to Norlys’ Privacy Policy for more  information. 


Norlys Credits: Credits received in your Personal Wallet from referrals, promotion codes or by participation in  PowerBank, may only be used for purchases in the Norlys app and cannot be withdrawn. Referrals and  promo codes may only be shared with individuals who are not existing Norlys Opladning users. Any violation  hereof will result in such credits being annulled. Unused Credits are automatically and without notice  removed from your Personal Wallet(s) 6 months from the date they were received. 


The Danish Consumer Ombudsman (Forbrugerombudsmanden) handles complaints regarding Norlys’  general terms and marketing. Further, Forbrugerombudsmanden may handle complaints on information  rights, third party misuse of card, best practices, etc. in accordance with the Danish Payment Act.
