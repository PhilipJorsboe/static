These Terms and Conditions (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) are entered into between the entity/person using or accessing the Services (&quot;the User&quot; or &quot;You&quot;) and Monta ApS (&quot;Monta&quot; or &quot;we&quot;), collectively referred to as the &quot;Parties&quot; or each a &quot;Party&quot;.

These Agreement together with the Monta [Privacy Policy](https://app.monta.app/privacy-policy) govern your use of the services operated by Monta (&quot;Services&quot;).

These Services includes, but is not limited to, all features and functionalities, including but not limited to websites, user portals, mobile applications, content and user interfaces, associated with Monta&#39;s platform for electric car drivers and charge point operators, where users can manage and find charge points to start and pay for charging processes of electric vehicles.

**2. Acceptance**

By registering for the Services and accepting these Terms of Use you enter into an agreement with Monta which allows you to use the Services.

All transactions that are part of the Services including, but not limited to, ordering of charging keys and initiating charging sessions, are governed by such agreement. Registration without explicit acceptance of these Terms of Conditions is not possible.

When you make an order for the charging of an electric vehicle through the Services, Monta acts as an agent on behalf of the Operator to conclude your order and to manage your experience throughout the order process. Monta is not liable and does not take any responsibility for the provision of the charging of electric vehicles by users.

**3. Prices**

All applicable prices are exclusive of VAT or unless otherwise stated and are indicated on the Services before the start of a charging process or any other transaction is initiated.

Monta is free for personal use, but may charge for certain Services, such as transaction fees for facilitating sharing of charge points to other users.

For enterprises, business entities and other partners, Services may include both transaction fees and monthly subscription plans.

Monta also sells physical goods, such as charge keys, QR stickers and SIM cards on the Monta Shop, where the prices will be clearly stated before purchase.

Before the charging process, the price will be clearly displayed as fees per kWh of consumed energy, parking fees for time of parking at the charging station, and if applicable charging session starting fees and fees for time of charging. There may also be fees if the User decides to reserve a charging station, and if they do not show up, or overstay. You acknowledge that the final and payable price of the charging service is directly dependent on use, for example on the amount of consumed energy, and is therefore not always automatically provided before the start of the charging process.

The User may transfer their desired amount of money to their customer account (“Monta Wallet”) to be used to pay for charging processes. The User may choose to transfer money to their Monta Wallet either manually or automatically when the balance goes below a certain amount. The User may also withdraw their balance from their Monta Wallet. After each charging transaction, the amount corresponding to the transaction is charged from the Monta Wallet. Monta shall deliver a receipt of the use of the charging Service, including each charging transaction executed. The User must see to it that the Monta Wallet has sufficient balance for the charging transaction.

Other payment methods include debit/credit card and invoices.
