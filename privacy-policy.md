**3. How do we store your data?**

Monta maintains industry standard security safeguards to protect your data. We encrypt data in transit and at rest, where appropriate, to ensure that your information is kept private. Monta securely stores your data on our secure (password- and firewall-protected) servers. All payment information is fully encrypted and handled only by PCI certified organizations.

Monta seeks to limit the period for which the personal data are stored to a minimum. Thus, Monta processes your personal data only to the extent and as long as is necessary to meet the purposes of the data processing.

In broad terms, we will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this privacy policy. This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of the data and the reason that we have the data in the first place. We have procedures in place regarding our retention periods which we keep under review taking into account our reasons for processing your personal data and the legal basis for doing so.

We retain your information as long as required to provide the goods and services requested by you, for record keeping purposes, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce the terms for our services. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain information about you, or otherwise upon your request, we will dispose of it in a secure manner or anonymize the information.

Information that Monta collects may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this policy.

You acknowledge that the transmission of information over the internet is inherently insecure, and Monta cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet. Emails sent via the internet might not be encrypted, so we advise you not to include any confidential or sensitive information in your emails to us.

Access controls are in place to limit access to your information to those who need it to perform their jobs. For example, information about you may be provided to our customer support team to help you with your requests.
